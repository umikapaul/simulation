This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

Names: Umika Paul, Yasser Elmzoudi, Fernanda Rizo

### Timeline

Start Date: 10/03/20

Finish Date: 10/19/20

Hours Spent: 180

### Primary Roles

All: Each member helped and worked with other members to implement their portions of the project. Each part of the project involved contributions from all members.

Umika Paul: Responsible for the backend of the project. She made the abstract classes, enum, and concrete classes for the Cell and Grid to allow for proper functioning of the six simulations. She was also responsible for implementing the different edge and neighborhood policies. She wrote all the tests for these classes. 

Fernanda Rizo: Responsible for the frontend of the project. She was responsible for the classes including the GamePane, ScreenVisuals, and ButtonPanel. She worked to make the simulation more user interactive through implementing colors, styles, and languages. She wrote the tests for these classes.

Yasser Elmzoudi: Responsible for configuration and exceptions. He wrote the classes encapsulating the exceptions and ErrorPanel, and was responsible for proper functioning of the graph. He also separated the controller from the view and helped structure the code.

### Running the Program

Main class:

Start: Contains the method to <code>launch args</code> and run the program.

Data files needed: 

All the data csv files are located in the data folder. The properties files are located in the resources directory in src, and the properties files for the languages are located in the languageresources directory. The css files are located in 

Note: For the tests, some of the files needed to run the tests are in the <code>Test Sources</code> folder. This folder needs to be set as the Test Resources root.
